# 1. This script is applicable only for Upgrade scenarios in AWS deployments
# 2. The fix for DLPX-75209 shifts to use mac addresses instead of canonical network
# interface names. To handle this change for upgrades, we save a map from interface
# names to their mac addresses. Post reboot, this script will be called as part of
# the PreExecStart directive in systemd-networkd service.
# 3. The script takes the map and matches the keys with the existing interface names
# in the netplan file, and for each such match, replaces the interface name with the
# corresponding mac address stored in the map file
